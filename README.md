Skills practiced: Math.min, Math.max, spread operator, createElement, const, classList, innerHTML, append, template literals.

I used two new Math objects to find the smallest and largest values in an array: Math.min() and Math.max().The Math.min() and Math.max() methods work with individual numbers (ex: Math.min(3, 6, 2) // 2), not arrays. I also used the spread operator to send the individual array elements to the Math methods instead of the whole array.
